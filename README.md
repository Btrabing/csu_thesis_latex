## An Unofficial Colorado State University Thesis/Dissertation LaTeX Template

This repository contains a LaTeX template for Colorado State
University theses and dissertations. Where the formatting in
the guidelines allows, the template defaults to formatting used
in publications by the American Meteorological Socoiety. Specifically,
the AMS reference and citation formattings are used.

## Style options
 * **master** - including 'masters' will change 'Doctor of Philosophy' to 'Master of Science' for the degree
 * **10pt, 11pt, 12pt** - CSU allows the font size of the main text to be within 10-12 pts. The title page, copyright page, and abstract are fixed at 12pt
 * **times** - Adobe Systems Utopia (1989) is the default serif font. Using times will load mathptmx
 * **blue** - makes the text for urls and references blue rather than black
 * **smallfoot** - makes the page number scriptsize rather than footnotesize
 * ** linenumbers** - if you want linenumbers, you can have linenumbers
 * **nocopyright** - CSU now requires the copyright page. If this changes, nocopyright restores old format

No guarantees are made that the template complies to current
university style guidelines.
